    * Although the component delegates hero deletion to the HeroService, it remains responsible for updating its own list of heroes.
    * The component's delete() method immediately removes the hero-to-delete from that list, anticipating that the HeroService will succeed on the server.
    * There's really nothing for the component to do with the Observable returned by heroService.delete() but it must subscribe anyway.
    *
    * If you neglect to subscribe(), the service will not send the delete request to the server.
    * As a rule, an Observable does nothing until something subscribes.
    * Confirm this for yourself by temporarily removing the subscribe(), clicking "Dashboard", then clicking "Heroes".
    * You'll see the full list of heroes again.

  /*
  * Observable.subscribe() is the critical difference.
  * The previous version assigns an array of heroes to the component's heroes property.
  * The assignment occurs synchronously,
  * as if the server could return heroes instantly or the browser could freeze the UI while it waited for the server's response.
  * That won't work when the HeroService is actually making requests of a remote server.
  * The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€” which could happen now or several minutes from now.
  * Then subscribe passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.
  * This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.
